    <p>Hello, everyone! I am <em>Danbi Kim</em>.</p>
    <p>
      I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering at <a href = "https://continuum.kaist.ac.kr/">the Laboratory for Solid Mechanics & Materials in Extreme</a> Environments at <a href = "https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/">KAIST</a> (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology). With a strong foundation in mathematics—thanks to a double major in Mathematics and Aerospace Engineering—I enjoy tackling complex problems across disciplines. I am eager to contribute to multidisciplinary environments, where I can bridge diverse fields to develop creative and robust solutions.
      I work in the <a href="#">Laboratory for Solid Mechanics & Materials in Extreme</a>  
      at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology).
